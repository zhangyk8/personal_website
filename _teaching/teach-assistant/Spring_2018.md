### Course Descriptions

This is the second honor course for elite sophomores of the Applied Mathematics group at Yat-sen Honor College. As what we conducted in the first course ([Fourier Analysis and its Applications](https://zhangyk8.github.io/teaching/fourier)), the enrolled student will continue lecturing to the class in a pre-assigned order, following the main stream of the prestigious textbook, _Matrix Analysis (Written by Roger A. Horn and Charles R. Johnson)_.
