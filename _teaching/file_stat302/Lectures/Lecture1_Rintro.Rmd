# Why Do We Learn Statistical Computing?

**An Example From My Research**: Cosmic Web Detection with Observed Galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

<p align="center">
<img src="./figures/cosmic_web_stellar.png" width="750"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<font size="4">See my paper at
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2504">MNRAS</a> and our <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6244866">cosmic web catalog</a> (i.e., a well-documented dataset). </font>
</p>


One scientific question that we address here is "*how is the stellar mass of a galaxy correlated with its distance to nearby cosmic web structures?*"

---

# Why Do We Learn Statistical Computing?

- We need to conduct simulation studies to validate our statistical theory and methodology.

--

  - For example, we can verify the asymptotic normality of our proposed statistical estimator with finite samples.

# Canvas Discussion

* It is worth up to 2% extra credit on the final grade.

* Only substantive and helpful questions will be counted.


.pull-left[
### Bad questions:

* How do you do Problem 2?

* Here's my code and it's broken. How can I fix it?
]

--

.pull-right[
### Good questions:
* Here's a snippet of code that I used for Problem 2: 
<br/>`formatted code snippet`
<br/>It returned the following error:
<br/>`formatted error message`
<br/>Does anyone know why? I already tried...

* I don't understand the concept from Slide 18 today. Could anyone elaborate on why...?
]

# Canvas Discussion

* It is worth up to 2% extra credit on the final grade.

* Only substantive and helpful answers will be counted.

.pull-left[
### Bad or null answers:
* Here's my solution:
<br/>`formatted code snippet`

* The grader is wrong. You should ask the grader to add your points back...

(*However, you are encouraged to point out my mistakes and typos during lectures or on the discussion board.*)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Good answers:
* This error message occurs because your variable is a string instead of a numeric.
Have you tried checking...?

* I think that Slide 18 in Lecture 2 will address your questions.

# Why R?

R is a programming language developed by statisticians for statistical computing.

### Pros:
* R is open-source and has a community of developers and users.
* It is convenient for statistical analysis and data visualization...

<p align="center">
<img src="./figures/language.png" width="300"/>
</p>

--

### Cons:
* R is slow unless we use parallel computing packages or [Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org/).
* It is not very popular outside of the statistical community.

--

It is not convenient to write programs with thousands of R code lines directly in the R interface!

---

# Why RStudio?

Luckily, we have [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for writing and running R programming.
--

* We recommend to first install R. Then, Rstudio will automatically locate the R directory in our computer.

* It helps us organizes R scripts, files, plots, code console, etc.

* It provides helpful interactive graphical interface.

--

* And more essentially, it has R Markdown integration.

For the rest of the course, we will use Rstudio to write our code and finish the lab assignments.

---


# RStudio Interface

By default...

* *Top left*: Editor panel. Browse and edit scripts or data with tabs.

* *Top right*: List of objects in the Environment (recall `ls()`), code history, etc.

* *Bottom left*: Console for running R code line-by-line (`>` prompt)

* *Bottom right*: Files, plots, packages, help files, etc.

If the Edit window is not open, then choose File -> New File -> Choose R Script.

---

# Editor

* Our important code should be written here (**not** the console).

* Primarily used for writing and editing .R or .Rmd scripts.
  
* Try opening a file now using *File > New File > R Script*, write two lines of simple code, such as `1 + 3` or `a = 6`.

* Click `Run` in the bar above the script. What happens?

* Click on one of the lines of code. Press `Ctrl`/`âŒ˜` + `Enter`. What happens?

--

.center[**Important:** Every part of our R workflow belongs in this window!]

---

# Console and Environment/History

#### Console

* It gives us an easy way to run and test individual lines of code.

* Nothing that we run here will be saved after we close Rstudio (unless you save the R history)!

--

#### Environment/History

* The variables that we defined can be seen in the _Environment_ tab.

* Click on the _History_ tab to see what it contains. Try searching!

* Select a line from the _History_ tab and click `To Source`. What happens?
 - It is useful for adding lines that we tested in our Console to our R scripts.

---

# Files, Plots, Packages, Help

* _Files_ tab is used to browse the files on our computer.

  * Open files/data, move files that we are working with, etc.
  
  * **Use caution!** Changing files here is the same as changing them on our computer. If we delete something, it's gone!
  
* _Plots_ tab is used to display plots that we create in R.

* _Help_ tab is used to browse the documentations of functions. We can explore these by preceding a function name with `?`. 

  Try `?sqrt` to see its user documentation. (If we are unsure about any function, ask R in this way!)

* _Packages_ tab shows all the packages that we currently have installed. (We will discuss more about it later.)

---

# Why R Markdown?

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a markup language for combining R code with text.

* It facilitates the creations of those neat HTML files, PDF documents, slides (like the one I am using), webpages, books, etc.

--

* And more importantly, it is required for our lab assignments and final project!

---

# Create an R Markdown File

Let's try creating an R Markdown file:

1. Choose *File > New File > R Markdown...*.

2. Make sure *PDF Output* is selected and click OK.

3. Save the file in your new folder, call it `stat302_test1.Rmd`.

4. Click the *Knit* button
  * After it is done, browse to the file location using the `Files` tab. What have been added?

Note: The PDF output requires an installation of $\LaTeX$; see the instructions [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html).

# R Code Within R Markdown

As in Lab 1, we can run and execute R code within R Markdown. 
To do so, we need to encase our code as follows.


    `r ''````{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
    # Your code goes here!
    ```

We can click the green triangle in the corner to evaluate that code chunk to preview the results without compiling the entire document.

---

# Useful Code Chunk Parameters

Parameters go into the opening brackets `{r}` and are separated by commas. Here are some useful options:

* `echo=FALSE`: Hide R code but keep results.

* `eval=FALSE`: Do not execute the R code.

* `include=FALSE`: Hide all outputs for this chunk (It is useful to load packages at the beginning of your document).

* `cache=TRUE`: Store the results of the chunk, and only re-run if the chunk is changed. (It is useful for files that take a while to compile).

* `fig.height=5, fig.width=5`: Modify the dimensions of any plots that are generated in the chunk (units are in inches).

Note: See the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for a complete list of knitr chunk options.

# R as a Calculator

* **Binary (Arithmetic) Operators** take two arguments. For instance, +, -, *, /, %% (for mod), %/%(integer division), and ^ (exponentiation).

```{r}
# Addition
6 + 1
```

```{r}
# Subtraction
9 - 16.6
```

```{r}
# Multiplication
6 * 3
```

---

# R as a Calculator

```

* **Unitary (Arithmetic) Operators** take only one argument. For example, - is for arithmetic negation.

---

# R as a Calculator

* We can also use some build-in functions in R to calculate more advanced math functions.

```{r}
# Exponentiation with natural basis "e"
exp(3)
```

```{r}
# Trigonometric functions
sin(pi)
cos(2*pi)
```

---

```

```{r}
# Logarithm with base 10
log(10, base=10)

# Ask R (in the console) if we are unsure of 
# any function and its arguments
?log
```

---

# Comparison Operators

```{r}
# Strictly greater than
6 > 3
# Greater than or equal to
6 >= 6
```

```{r}
# Equal to
5 == 3
5 == 2 + 3
```

---

# Comparison Operators

```{r}
# Not equal to
6 != 3
```

```{r}
# Strictly less than
6 < 6
# Less than or equal to
6 <= 6
```

---

# Logical Operators

* **Logical Operators** take one or more "comparison statements" and return TRUE or FALSE.

```{r}
# AND
(6 < 5) & (1 < 3)
```

```{r}
# AND
(6 < 9) & (1 <= 3)
```

---

# Logical Operators

* **Logical Operators** take one or more "comparison statements" and return TRUE or FALSE.

```{r}
# OR
(6 < 5) | (1 < 3)
```

```{r}
# OR
(6 < 5) | (1 <= -3)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Combine AND with OR operators
(6 < 5) & (7 > 2) | (1 <= 3)
```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Combine AND with OR operators
(6 < 5) & (7 > 2) | (1 <= 3)
```


---

# Logical Operators

* **Logical Operators** take one or more "comparison statements" and return TRUE or FALSE.

```{r}
# Logical negation
!(6 < 5)
```

```{r}
# Logical negation
!(6 < 9)
```

# Part 3: Data Types in R

---

# Functional Programming

Functional programming in R comprises two basic types of things/objects: **data** and **functions**.
--

* **Data** are things like 8, "James", *NA*, and 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 3 & 6\\
4 & 7 & -1\\
\end{bmatrix}.$$

--

* **Functions** are some programs that turns input objects, or *arguments*, into an output object or a return value (possibly with side effects), according to a definite rule. 

--

* Good programming is writing functions to correctly and efficiently transform inputs into outputs. (We will discuss functions later...)
  - <font size="4"> The principle of good programming is to take a big transformation and break it down into smaller ones so that we can efficiently implement these smaller tasks (using built-in functions). </font>

---

# Data Types

At the base level, all data can represented in binary format, by **bits** (i.e., TRUE/FALSE, YES/NO, 1/0). However, basic data types in R are:

- **Booleans** are direct binary values: `TRUE` or `FALSE` in R.

- **Integers** are whole numbers (positive, negative or zero), represented by a fixed-length block of bits.

- **Floating point numbers** are (some approximations) to rational numbers, i.e., $p/q$ where $p,q$ are both integers. 

- **Complex numbers** are numbers like 1+2i.

- **Characters** are fixed-length blocks of bits, with special coding; **strings** are sequences of characters.

- **Missing or ill-defined values**: `NA`, `NaN`, etc.

---

# Data Types (Examples)

```{r}
?typeof()

typeof(TRUE)

# By default, R stores numeric values as 64 floating points.
typeof(6)

# We can coerce it into integer as follows.
typeof(as.integer(6))

typeof(as.integer(6.5))
```

---

# Data Types (Examples)

```{r}
as.integer(6.6)

# It rounded a floating point number 6.5 to the largest 
# integer that is less than 6.5.
floor(6.6)

typeof("7")

length("7112")
```

---

# Data Types (Examples)

```{r}
is.character("7")

is.na(6.6)

is.na(NA)

?NaN
```

* We can also use the build-in function `class()` to determine the data type of an object.

---

# Variables in R

- With the preceding arithmetic operations, it is difficult for us to utilize the outputs.

--

- To better keep track of the intermediate results, we can assign the (outputs of) expressions to some **named variables**.

- Naming variables is the first step towards abstraction in functional programming.

--

```{r}
a = 1 + 2
course_code = "STAT 302"
dept = paste("Statistics", "Data Science")

# List all the variables that we have defined
ls()
```

Note: `<-` and `=` are both valid assignment operators.

---

# Variables in R

* A variable in R has its name and value.

* We can access a variable by its name.

```{r}
# Access variable `a`
a

# Check the data type of `course_code`
class(course_code)

# Remove a variable (from R memory)
rm("a")
```

Note: We can also keep track of all the defined variables in the _Environment_ tab (**Top right** in Rstudio). 

---

# Rules for Variable's Name

* A variable's name must follow some rules:

  - It cannot start with a digit or underscore `_`.
  
  - It may contain characters, digits, and some punctuation (period `.` and underscore `_` are allowed, while others are generally prohibited).
  
  - It is case-sensitive.
  
--

```{r}
w2v = 1 + 4
W2v = "word to vector"
w2v == W2v
```

---
