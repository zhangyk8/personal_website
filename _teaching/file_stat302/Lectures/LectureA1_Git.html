# Why Do We Need Git?

When working a research project/paper solely or collaboratively with others, we may end up creating a folder with files as follows:
* draft1.docx
* Draft2.docx
* draft2_profcomments.docx
* draft_final.docx
* Simulation_v1.R
* Simulation_v2.R
* Simulation_v2_asdf.R
* Simulation_v3.R
* actualfinaldraft.tex
* actualfinaldraft.pdf
* paper_bib.bib
* Draft_comments.tex
* Draft_comments.pdf

# Why Do We Need Git?

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/phdcomics.png" width="370"/&gt;

- Fortunately, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) can help us keep track of changes and comments without creating multiple files.

---

# Why Do We Need Git?

- In short, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a **version control system**.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/git.png" width="200"/&gt;

--

  - It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the Linux kernel.

--

  - It was originally developed to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects.

--

  - It manages the evolution of a set of files called a **repository** in a highly structured way.
  
--

  - The Git-based projects can be hosted on some online services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), etc.

- Online Git-based projects are similar to Google Drive or Dropbox but works better for projects with intensive coding and software developments.

---

# Some Benefits of Using Git

1. Keep old versions of our files indefinitely (tracking changes so that making any reversions is simple).

--

2. Work with multiple collaborators:

  - Keeps track of who changed what and when they changed it.
  
--
  
3. Changes are automatically integrated into the most recent version, and conflicts receive warnings.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/git-benefits.png" width="350"/&gt;

---
# Install Git - Mac/Linux

**Mac/Linux:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is probably pre-installed for these operating systems.

- Open the `Terminal` app and type `git --version` to confirm which version that has been installed and `which git` to find out where it is. 

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/git_version.png" width="550"/&gt;

- If for some reason Git is not pre-installed, we can download it from [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

  * Ubuntu or Debian Linux: `sudo apt-get install git`

  * Fedora or RedHat Linux: `sudo yum install git`

- Other installation instructions can be found [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git).

---

# Install Git - Windows
  
**Windows:** Here is one option of the two listed [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git).

 * Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (also known as `msysgit` or "Git Bash") to get Git in addition to the Bash shell. 
 
 * **Important note:** When asked about "Adjusting your PATH environment", make sure to select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software".
 
 * Note that RStudio for Windows prefers for Git to be installed below `C:/Program Files` and this appears to be the default. This implies, for example, that the Git executable on our Windows system is found at `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe`. Unless we have specific reasons to otherwise, follow this convention.

Hopefully, after following the instructions above, we have a Git Bash shell. To check this, open our shell and type `echo $SHELL`. We should see something like `usr/bin/bash`.

# Part 2: Introduction to GitHub

---

# Why GitHub?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a software that can be used locally.

- We don't need to access to the Internet for proper version controls on our computer.

--

However, if we want to share our work or collaborate with others, we need to use some online repository services.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/github.png" width="300"/&gt;

-  We target [GitHub](https://github.com/) - not [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - for the sake of specificity and popularity. 

  - This [blog](https://radixweb.com/blog/github-vs-gitlab) discusses pros and cons of GitHub v.s. Gitlab.

---

# Benefits of Using GitHub

1. Like RStudio with R, GitHub adds many user-friendly features to Git.

  * Effective collaboration and code distribution.

  * Allow others to comment on our code and suggest changes (pull requests/issues).

  * Building our coding portfolio!

--

2. We can benefit from using R and Rstudio with GitHub.

  - There is an active R package development community on GitHub.

  - Rstudio has Git- and GitHub-related features.

---

# Special features of GitHub (*)

In addition to a well-designed user interface, GitHub offers two especially important features:

- **Issues:** A list of bugs, feature requests, to-dos, etc.

  - Issues are tightly integrated with email and allow us to copy/embed important conversations in the associated repo.
  
  - Issues can be assigned to people (e.g., to-dos) and tagged ("bug" or "progress-report").
  
  - Issues are tightly integrated with commits and allow us to record the changes.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/ggplot2_issues.png" width="500"/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;font size="5"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues"&gt;Issues&lt;/a&gt; page of ggplot2.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

# Special features of GitHub (*)

In addition to a well-designed user interface, GitHub offers two especially important features:

- **Pull Requests:** A formal proposal for making changes on the main development branch.

  - Git allows a project to have multiple, independent branches of development, with the notion that some should eventually be merged back into the main development branch.
  
  - GitHub facilitates and preserves the discussion of the [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), holistically and line-by-line.

---
# Register A GitHub Account

Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and register a free account!

- GitHub can become a part of our professional portfolio, and it is likely that we plan to do any coding as part of our career. 

- So choose our username **carefully**! Some rules of thumb:

  * Incorporate our actual name to increase visibility and recognizability.

  * Reuse our username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.

  * Shorter is better than longer.

  * Make it timeless (don't include the current affiliation, etc.)

  * All lowercase is recommended.

---
# Set Up Git (Optional) (*)

Run the following in our shell/terminal (fill in your information):


```bash
git config --global user.name 'Firstname Lastname'
git config --global user.email 'email@website.com'
git config --global --list
```

**Note:** The email should be the one associated with our GitHub account!

We also suggest setting up our default editor. At some point when we have a merge conflict, Git will push us into an editor to resolve it. (For instance, we can use Sublime Text on a Mac).

Alternatively, we can set our Git username and email within R:


```r
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Firstname Lastname", user.email = "email@website.com")
```


Check out [Software Carpentry's guide](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html) for more examples of what line to run for different editor-operating system combinations.

---
# Install a Git Client (Optional) (*)

Sometimes it could be useful to install a GUI for git. 

- For instance, [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), which works on all common operating systems.

See [this webpage](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html) to see Jenny Bryan's notes for various git clients as well as why they are helpful.

We will discuss more about using Git with Rstudio later. Here is a [summary guideline](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html).

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/github-Rstudio.jpg" width="400"/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---
# Create A New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to GitHub and click the green "New Repository" button. 

2. Repository name: `git_intro` or similar, following the [naming conventions](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Naming-Repos.md) here.

3. Description: Whatever you want, but fill in something.

4. Public or Private. 

  - GitHub offers free unlimited private repositories for all users.

  - These free private repositories support up to three external collaborators, making them a perfect place for our personal projects, for job applications, and for testing things out before making our project open source.

5. YES initialize the repository with a README.

6. Choose a license (optional).

---
# Add Collaborators to A GitHub Repo (*)

We can always add collaborators to our GitHub repos through their usernames or emails.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/Github_collaborators.png" width="800"/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

# Part 3: Basic Git Commands

---
# Commits, Diffs, and Tags

We now connect the fundamental concepts of Git to the data science workflow:

--

- **repository:** A repository or repo is just a directory of files that Git manages holistically. 

--

- **commit:** A commit functions like a snapshot of all the files in the repo, at a specific moment.

  - We must also write a short **commit message** every time we make a commit.
  
  - Every commit needs a nickname to identify it. Git automatically assigns each commit what is called a SHA (Simple Hashing Algorithm), a seemingly random string of 40 letters and numbers.
  
  - We can also designate certain snapshots as special with a **tag**, which is a name of our choosing.
  
---
# Commits, Diffs, and Tags

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/commit-diff-sha-tag.png" width="600"/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- **diff:** The set of differences between Version A and B of a file is called a "_diff_" and Git users contemplate diffs a lot.

  - We can inspect the diffs between any two commits and keep track of the **history** of our project.

---
# Run the Git Commands With the Shell (*)

The **shell** is a program on our computer that runs other programs. 
Sometimes, people use the terms `Terminal`, `Console`, `Command Line`, and `Shell` interchangeably.

We can also open a shell within RStudio:

* *Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New Terminal* to launch a shell within RStudio. This will often be sufficient for our purposes.
  
* **Windows:** Here, we focus on the **Git Bash** shell, which should have come with our install of Git for Windows. 
  
  * Confirm that RStudio detected the presence of Git Bash. This should have happened automatically if we installed in the default location, but check by going to *Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal* and make sure we see `Git Bash` under "_New terminals open with:_".

---
# Basic Shell Commands (*)

* `pwd` (**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory). Shows the current working directory of our shell.

* `ls` (**l**ist **f**iles). Shows the files in the current working directory. Use `ls -a` to also list hidden files, such as .Rhistory and .git.

* `cd` (**c**hange **d**irectory). Allows us to navigate through our directories by changing the shell's working directory.

  * We can use relative paths such as `..` (parent directory) and `.` (current directory).
  * `~` is still your home directory.
  * We can drag and drop a file or folder into the shell window to paste the absolute path.
  * We can use `Tab` to autocomplete unambiguous directory and file names. 
  
* Navigate previous commands with _arrow-up_ and _arrow-down_.

* Search for previous commands with `ctrl + r`.

`\(\hspace{5em} \vdots\)`

---
# Basic Git Commands (*)

These commands are used within the Shell/Terminal, and we will show how to run some of these commands in Rstudio as well.

* New local git repo from a repo on GitHub:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhangyk8/git_intro.git
```

* `git remote -v` lists all remotes and check that the remote was cloned successfully.

* `git remote add origin GITHUB_URL` adds the remote `GITHUB_URL` with nickname origin.

* `git add FILENAME` stages changes to the file. Will add the file to the tracked files if it isn't already. Use `git add .` to add all untracked files (but be careful with this!)

* `git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"` commit all staged changes.

---
# Basic Git Commands (*)

* `git status` informs us of our current branch, any changes or untracked files, and whether we are in sync with our remotes.

* `git log` shows the commit logs.

* `git diff` show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

* `git pull` pulls commits from remote to local copy.

* `git push` pushes from local copy to remote.

* `git fetch` fetches commits.

* `git checkout` switch to a branch.

* `git init` creates an empty git repo within our current directory.

The detailed documentation can be found at [https://git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs).

---
# Clone Our Git Repo from GitHub (*)

.middler-nocent[
1. Open a shell/Terminal window.

2. **Change our working directory to a new folder or desired folder.**

3. Clone the repo by entering (filling in the relevant info):
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
  ```
  **Notes:** we can get the direct link by navigating to our repo and clicking the green "&lt;&gt; Code" button and copying the text from the "HTTPS" option.
  
4. explore our repo by entering (filling in the relevant info):

```bash
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
ls
head README.md
git remote show origin
git status
```
]

---
# Commit and Push A Local Change (*)

1. Edit our README within shell by using the following line.
  
  ```bash
  echo "A line I wrote using the shell on my local computer" &gt;&gt; README.md
  ```

2. Check the status
  
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

3. Stage our commit and check the status
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git status
  ```

4. Commit and push and check the status
  
  ```bash
  git commit -m "A commit from my local computer"
  git push
  git status
  ```
  
Now check the repository online at GitHub. What changed?

---
# Notes on GitHub Credentials (*)

When we interact with GitHub, we have to include credentials in the request.

- Unfortunately, GitHub no longer accepts the password when we talk to GitHub as a Git server.

With HTTPS, we will use a **personal access token (PAT)**.

- Alternatively, we can also [set up keys for the SSH credential](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys).

On [GitHub](https://github.com/), after signing in, we can manage our personal access tokens from [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

- It is also reachable via "Settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Personal access tokens".

We could click on "Generate new token" here, or call `usethis::create_github_token()` from R.

---
# Notes on GitHub Credentials (*)

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/git_token.png" width="750"/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Read more detailed instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

---
# Collaboration on Repo Through Branches (*)

Branching allows one or many people to work in parallel without overwriting each other's work.

- Create a new branch:

```bash
git branch BRANCH-NAME
# Switch to the new branch
git checkout BRANCH-NAME
```

- Once we have done our work and committed it to the feature branch, you can switch back to `main` and merge the feature branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge BRANCH-NAME
```

---
# Dealing With Conflicts in Merging (*)

Most of the time, the merge will go smoothly. However if both the branches we are merging changed the same part of the same file, we will get a merge conflict.

```bash
git merge BRANCH-NAME
# Auto-merging index.html
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

- To solve a merge conflict, we should determine which files are in conflict, which we can do with `git status`:

```bash
git status
# On branch main
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
# 
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to mark resolution)
# 
#     both modified:      index.html
# 
# no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---
# Dealing With Conflicts in Merging (*)

- This shows only `index.html` is unmerged and needs to be resolved. We can open the file using any editor to see what lines are in conflict.

```bash
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:index.html
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;contact : email.support@github.com&lt;/div&gt;
=======
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
 please contact us at support@github.com
&lt;/div&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue-5:index.html
```

- In this conflict, the lines between `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:index.html` and `======` are the content from the branch we are currently on. The lines between `=======` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue-5:index.html` are from the feature branch we are merging.

---
# Dealing With Conflicts in Merging (*)

- To resolve the conflict, edit this section until it reflects the state we want in the merged result. Pick one version or the other or create a hybrid. Also remove the conflict markers `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `======`, and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`.

```bash
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
please contact us at email.support@github.com
&lt;/div&gt;
```

- Now run `git add index.html` and `git commit` to finalize the merge. CONFLICTS RESOLVED.

**Notes:** If, during the merge, we get confused about the state of things or make a mistake, use `git merge --abort` to abort the merge and go back to the state prior to running `git merge`.

# Part 4: Connect Git, GitHub, and Rstudio

---

# Version Control of R Projects With Git

For new or existing projects, we recommend doing the followings:

- Dedicate a local directory or folder to it.

- Make it an Rstudio Project (Optional but recommended; obviously only applies to projects involving R and users of RStudio).

- Make it a Git repository.

We will discuss in the sequel that

1. how to create a new Rstudio project based on our existing GitHub repo;

2. how to connect our existing project with a GitHub repo.

---
# Create Rstudio Project From GitHub Repo

We present two ways to do this:

**Option 1:** We can execute this command in any R session.


```r
usethis::create_from_github(
  "https://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO.git",
  destdir = "~/path/to/where/you/want/the/local/repo/"
)
```

**Option 2:** We can start a new Project in Rstudio:

1. *File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git*. In the "repository URL", paste the HTTPS URL for our GitHub repository.

2. Choose a desired directory and click "Open in new session".

**This is the recommended set up for all of our R projects!** 

That is, **first create on GitHub, then clone through RStudio.**

---
# Edit Our Repo Through RStudio

We should associate an R project with our GitHub repo.

  - If it is not already open, open that R project by double clicking on the project file.

**We should now see a `Git` pane within RStudio!**

1. Within the `Files` pane of RStudio, open `README.md`.

2. Add a new line of text "A commit from RStudio" to `README.md` and save.

3. Click `Diff` within the `Git` pane.

4. Click the box under `Staged` for the changed file (top left box).

5. Add a commit message within the box (top right).

6. Click `Commit` (top right).

7. Click `push` (top right). 

 - Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote

---
# Connect Existing R Project to GitHub Repo

- Make or verify that our existing project is an RStudio Project.

- Make or verify a Git repo. If not, we can use either of the following three options:

  1. In the R Console, call `usethis::use_git()`.
    
  2. In RStudio, go to "Tools &gt; Project Options &gt; Git/SVN". Under "Version control system", select "Git". Confirm New Git Repository? Yes!
  
  3. In the shell, with working directory set to the project's directory, do `git init`.
  
---
# Connect Existing R Project to GitHub Repo
  
- Create and connect a GitHub repo. We can use either of the following three options:

  1. In the R console, call `usethis::use_github()`.
  
  2. Use the RStudio IDE:
      - Create a GitHub repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/) as before. 
      - Click on the "two purple boxes and a white square" in the Git pane of Rstudio.
      - Click "Add remote". 
      - Paste the GitHub repo's URL here and pick a remote name, almost certainly origin. Now "Add".
  
  3. In a shell, do this after creating a GitHub repo, substituting your URL:


```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git
```
  
---
# Summary

- Git is a version control system that facilitates project managements and collaborations.

- GitHub is an online repository service for hosting Git projects.

- Git has its own commands and vocabulary.

  - We can work collaboratively through branching and resolve conflicts when merging a branch to the `main` branch.

- We can run Git commands and keep track of changes of our R projects through Rstudio.
