I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington (UW), Seattle, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/) and [Prof. Alexander Giessing](https://agiessing.github.io/). During 2019-2020, I served as the Master Student Representative for our department. Before joining UW, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics with the highest University Distinction at Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU). During my undergraduate, I was also an honor student at the Yat-Sen Honor College, an elite liberal undergraduate institution of SYSU. 

Research Interests
-----------
My current theoretical research interests are on kernel smoothing, nonparametric statistics, optimization on nonlinear manifolds, and high-dimensional inference with missing data. On the applied side, I am broadly interested in challenging problems in astronomy, especially about how to detect and analyze the cosmic web in a statistically motivated way.
