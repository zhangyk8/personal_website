## Talk Abstract

On megaparsec scales, matter in our Universe is not uniformly distributed but rather forms a complicated large-scale network structure called the cosmic web. Among its intricate characteristics, the one-dimensional cosmic filaments are of great research interest because they dominate the cosmic web in terms of matter and provide a valuable insight into the evolution of nearby galaxies.

In this talk, we present our statistical framework of recovering the cosmic filaments from galaxy samples in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In particular, we model these one-dimensional structures through directional density ridges, which can be practically identified by our proposed Directional Subspace Constrained Mean Shift (DirSCMS) algorithm. The algorithm and statistical framework behind it take into account the nonlinear geometry of the celestial sphere on which the galaxy samples lie and thus lead to less biased estimators of the underlying filament structures. We also prove the statistical consistency of our filament estimator based on directional kernel density estimator and the linear convergence of our proposed filament-finding algorithm. Finally, we briefly discuss how to generalize our framework to recover the cosmic filaments in the 3D (Right Ascension, Declination, Redshift) space. The talk is based on my recent works with Prof. Yen-Chi Chen and Prof. Rafael S. de Souza.
